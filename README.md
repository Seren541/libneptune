# libneptune

This repository is an attempt to open source the vital part of Neptune's code.

I will make it less dependent on Neptune AppImage Manager's data directories in the future by unsetting the hard paths which point to /etc/neptune/

For now this is simply to make the code open source and not intented to be used in other projects. With some modifications it probably could but any support I offer to you will be on my own good will.
